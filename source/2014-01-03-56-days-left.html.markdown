Time is flying... 56 days left.

Big goals is to have a firm foudation in Ruby and also be comfortable with testing (minitest, rspec, etc.) I hope that I can really break through some barriers over the next two months!

I think my biggest blocker at this point is going to be focusing on my task at hand (learning - instead of worrying about getting a job). I believe that the time I put in is adequate... this is one area I will look back on and KNOW without a doubt that I did my part on! Over the next couple months I think I will just have to make sure I am going over fundamentals and testing to be sure I will be as ready as possible for what's next... 

My concrete plan to get where I need to be:

1. Continue to pair with Katrina over the    fundamentals.

2. Continue to pair with Jorge over testing.

3. Continue to utilize my mentor.

4. Continue to use the Pragmatic series of videos/workbook to solidify what I have already learned.

Hopefully all these things - paired with my drive will get me where I need to be by the end of class. 

Looking forward to what 2014 will bring!
