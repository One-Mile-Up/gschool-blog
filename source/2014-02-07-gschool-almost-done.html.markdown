title: gSchool - almost done...

Over the next 3 weeks I am really looking forward to learning how to test/validate/document a project. My focus will be dedicated to just that... breaking crap and finding bugs.

I am really hoping to achieve a better knowledge of the Rails MVC and integration/regression testing. I think I will be able to get there simply by showing up to class early, keep my nose down, engage others by asking lots of questions when I am stuck (which will probably be pretty often! HA!) Oh, let's not forget LOTS of coffee too!

I am going to try and use Rspec and Capybara for the remainder of the program since this is in the scope of what I want to do when I leave gSchool - QA/testing! I really like getting out of the classroom - I feel like my mind opens up when I am not cooped up with 4 walls closing in all the time!

I feel like I have really started some good friendships here over the past couple of months or so... people that I feel like I will be able to reach out to even after gSchool! I hope to really start to gain more and more friendships like I have here as I continue this journey...
