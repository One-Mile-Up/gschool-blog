IdeaBox --

This was an interesting project for me. Although I am still struggling with the fundamentals of Ruby, I was excited to see that I was starting to notice  how things were working (thanks to the hand-holding throughout the tutorial). It would be awesome if I could just recall these things when I am looking at a blank screen and the cursor is blinking at me saying "well, where do we go from here?!?" I will get there, it's only a matter of exposure-time/effort/and lot's of blood on the brick wall from my forehead! haha :)

I learned that web applications are going to be lots of fun to build. Sinatra seems to be pretty "easy" to learn... as long as you have a solid foundation in Ruby. I liked working through IdeaBox on my own because I was able to go @ my own pace, and my performance wasn't affecting anyone but me. When I would get stuck - I would grab a fellow classmate/instructor to help me through the mud... it worked well for me. I don't have some bad-ass end product, but it's ok - I know that that will come with time and comfort. 

I unfortunately wasn't able to do any testing for this project. This is something I am currently working on with my mentor(s)... I really want to be able to build software that has a robust testing suite (if possible)! I believe that testing is what is going to help me build better performing software - and in the end, thats all I really care about.

When we were first given this project to complete, the tutorial wasn't complete with the testing requirement (it was added later). I noticed that a bunch of people got through the project pretty quick only to find out they had to "scrap it" and start over - only this time, using TDD. I kind of wish I would have just started out using TDD, I know I wouldn't have gotten very far, but - If I were to do it all over again, that's what I would do. 

I wasn't able to join the code retreat on Friday, I think it would have been really fun, and productive for the group as well as the individuals. I took Thursday and Friday of last week off... I went to Galveston, TX with my family for the weekend :)

I took my computer with me but was strongly encouraged NOT to open it up while I was there (Father-in-law & wife), hahaha! I really didn't have time anyway, there was something always going on - it would have been weird to seclude myself to work on "school stuff". Having a couple days off like that seemed to really get me excited about getting back into the class room and try to cram some more knowledge into my dome-piece.

I am glad to be back in the saddle!
