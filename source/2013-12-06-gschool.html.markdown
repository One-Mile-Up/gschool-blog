Fourth Meal --

Interesting project. We are in a group of 3, we pick one persons' past project (from Dinner Dash) and our group then has to build upon it. 

This time around, we are to take a more serious approach to how we are managing the project. We decided to use Pivitol Labs' "tracker" to get the job done! I am a fan of this type of work style... its easier to keep on track with what has been finished -vs- what still needs done... also, you always know where you stand with your teammates.
